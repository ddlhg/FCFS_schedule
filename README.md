# FCFS_scheduler

### Description
- The goal of this project is to evaluate the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) process scheduling algorithm by creating a program that simulates the algorithm. The number of processes, CPU bursts, and I/O time are all set in the code, so no user input is necessary. The results of this simulation will have: the response, waiting, turnaround, and total time for each process. As well as the order in which the processes were used.

### Languages and Utilities Used
- C++
- Visual Studio 
### Enviroments Used
- Windows 10
## Program Walk-through
**1.**  The code will display the current time, processes in the ready queue, processes in I/O, and the processes completed every time a processes is executed.

**2.** Result will be at the end of the simulation.
